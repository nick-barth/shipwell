Built using my react/typescript/reactrouter/redux boilerplate which is based off of create-react-app. I actually just bootstrapped it off another programming challenge I had done recently.

I have many regrets here, but I was operating under a rather strict timeline.  I completed this challenge in around exactly 4 hours.  Most of my time was spent fighting with the react/googlemaps
https://github.com/tomchentw/react-google-maps library I chose to use.  Normally I would almost always write my own components to handle integrations such as this, as it was a timed challenged I choose to use a library.  


Thanks for the challenge, I enjoyed it.


EDIT: Did the bonus to put Shipwell on the map!
